The mapper and reducer of the problem is desgined to merge files.
So for proper order we need to feed it with files in the right order.
It is described below in terms of problem number

Problem1: <userhandle> <Tweet file> <output Directory>

Problem 2: <User file> <Tweet File> <output Directory>

Problem 3: <Tweet file> <user file> <Output Directory>

Problem 4: <Tweet file> <user file> <Output Directory>
